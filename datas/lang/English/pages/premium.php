				<strong>Avantage</strong> : Fast, Paypal account is <strong>not</strong> needed, less expensive, many formulas<br />
				<strong>Inconvéniant</strong> : Card needed, Activation more slow (at the moment)

				It\'s the recommended method. Cheaper than the pay by phone and you can take more months to lower prices. Two possibility to pay: directly by card, without a Paypal account. Or with your Paypal account.

				If you don\'t want or can\'t pay by card, you can choose to pay by phone. But it\'s more expensive, because of operator cost. Another problem: the price is not the same for all countries.
				Exemple, it\'ll cost 2 calls of 1€43 each, 2€86, for France. But it\'ll cost 2 calls of 1€25 for Belgium. See the grid below.
